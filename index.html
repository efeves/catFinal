				<h2>The Client</h2>

				<p>Meet Elizabeth Smit. She's a brand new Physics teacher here at Da Vinci Communications as of this year. You may recognize her from her classroom right next door to Rachel's room, or from CD, where she and her advisory are a competitive force to be reckoned with. Just because she looks kind and happy, doesn't mean she isnt ready to take some names and kick the other Advisories to the curb in the Advisory Olympics.</p>

				<h2>The Item</h2>
				<img class="item" src=""></img>
				<p>This is a LED cat night light. It's made out of silicon with a plastic base that houses LED lights ranging from plain white lights, to a loop of Blue, Green, and Red lights. Elizabeth used this item as her choice of design because she enjoyed it's light and modern design. And, obviously, because it is just so cute! We wanted to capture the colors of the cat in the webpage, so the background color is the base color of the original cat. The gradient color in the above gif are complimentary colors for the base, in attempt to capture the idea behind the transitioning lights. In addition, we wanted to capture the minimalistic idea of the item, and as such tried to keep the website as simple as possible, for a simplistic base for a potential coloring book further on in a development process.</p>
